(\\\"REIT\\\" or the \\\"Company\\\"), a Maryland corporation, collectively the \\\"Parties.\\\" NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and other good and valuable consideration, the Parties hereby agree as follows: 1. Consulting Services. REIT hereby retains CONSULTANT and CONSULTANT hereby accepts appointment to serve as an independent contractor to the Company. During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall consult with REIT and provide the services outlined in the attached Statement of Work in a timely and professional manner in accordance with industry standards. CONSULTANT further agrees that it will not assign the responsibilities set forth in the attached Statement of Work to any other CONSULTANT, subcontactor or other individual without the express written agreement of the Company\\\\'s Chief Executive Officer. 2. No Control by the Company. The Parties agree that CONSULTANT shall use its own judgment as to the time, place, details, and means by which CONSULTANT will accomplish the results of CONSULTANT\\\\'s services under this Agreement, that CONSULTANT is not required to work set hours of the day or week established by the Company or perform specific services in a sequence determined by the Company, and that nothing contained herein shall be construed to create the relationship of employer and employee between the Company or CONSULTANT; provided, however, that CONSULTANT is expected to provide the services contemplated by this Agreement in a timely and competent manner in order to meet the needs and expectations of the Company. 3. Independent Contractor. The Parties expressly intend and agree that CONSULTANT is acting as an independent contractor and not as an employee of REIT. Under no circumstances shall CONSULTANT look to REIT as its employer, or as a partner, agent, or principal.

Compensation and Reimbursement. CONSULTANT shall be compensated and reimbursed for the services as set forth in the attached Statement of Work. Completeness of work product shall be determined by REIT in its sole discretion, and CONSULTANT agrees to make all revisions, additions, deletions or alterations as requested by the Company.

CONSULTANT further agrees not to cause the transmission, removal or transport of tangible embodiments of, or electronic files containing, Proprietary Information from REIT\\\\'s principal place of business, without prior approval of the Company. CONSULTANT shall disseminate Proprietary Information only to those employees of CONSULTANT with a special need to know such Proprietary Information. CONSULTANT warrants that such employees shall be informed of the proprietary nature of the Proprietary Information and shall be bound by this Agreement in the same manner that CONSULTANT is bound. 5.3 No Licenses. No rights or licenses in or to the Proprietary Information of REIT are granted to CONSULTANT by virtue of this Agreement. 6. Intellectual Property, Inventions and Patents.

CONSULTANT shall promptly disclose such Work Product to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and, at the Company\\\\'s expense, perform all actions reasonably requested by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (whether during or after the consultancy) to establish and confirm such ownership (including assignments, consents, powers of attorney and other instruments). CONSULTANT acknowledges that all copyrightable Work Product which is capable of being classified as \\\"works made for hire\\\" under the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976, as amended, shall be deemed \\\"works made for hire\\\" and that the Company shall be the author of, and own all rights therein. To the extent that any such copyrightable work is not a \\\"work made for hire,\\\" CONSULTANT hereby assigns and agrees to assign to the Company all right, title and interest, including a copyright, in and to such copyrightable work. Furthermore, CONSULTANT agrees to sign any written instrument of transfer for any rights relating to the Work Product which may be required to effect or evidence the assignment of rights in the Work Product to the Company. The foregoing provisions of this Section 6 shall not apply to any invention that CONSULTANT developed entirely on CONSULTANT\\\\'s own time without using the Company\\\\'s equipment, supplies, facilities or trade secret information, except for those inventions that (i) relate to the Company\\\\'s business or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (ii) result from any work performed by CONSULTANT for the Company.\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n7.

It is agreed that ownership of no more than 1% of the outstanding voting stock of a publicly traded corporation will not constitute a violation of Section 7.3. 7.4 Non-Disparagement. CONSULTANT acknowledges that any disparaging comments by him against the Company are likely to substantially depreciate the business reputation of the Company. CONSULTANT agrees to act in good faith so as to not harm the business reputation of the Company in any way.

CONSULTANT shall not take any materials, property, documents, or other information, or any reproduction or excerpt thereof, belonging to REIT or pertaining to any Proprietary Information. 8.2 Obligations Surviving Termination. The obligations of Sections 3, 5, 6 and 7 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 8.3 Change of Control.

A Change of Control shall be any purchase of equity in the Company by a party that results in the party acquiring (i) voting control of the Company or (ii) the authority to replace or appoint, a majority of the Board, or the CEO or COO or CFO of the Company. 9. General Provisions. 9.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire and exclusive agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations, and understandings of the Parties regarding their consulting relationship. 9.2 Severability. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this Agreement is in violation of any law or public policy, only the portions of this Agreement that violate such law or public policy shall be stricken. All portions of this Agreement that do not violate any statute or public policy shall continue in full force and effect. Further, any court order striking any portion of this Agreement shall modify the stricken terms as narrowly as possible to give as much effect as possible to the intentions of the parties under this Agreement. 9.3 Representations and Warranties.

For clarity, while CONSULTANT may create original ideas that are Work Product herein, CONSULTANT cannot, and does not warrant that those ideas can be exploited by Company with out infringing the rights of other parties.\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n9.4 Successors and Assigns.

CONSULTANT agrees that it shall not be eligible for or entitled to participate in any PTO, benefit plans, retirement and insurance coverage provided by the Company or its subsidiary and affiliated entities to their respective employees. CONSULTANT also acknowledges and agrees that the Company will issue a Form 1099 for all compensation paid to CONSULTANT, and it is CONSULTANT\\\\'s obligation to report and pay all federal, state and local income, payroll, self-employment and other taxes due for her on all compensation from the Company as may be required by law. CONSULTANT agrees to indemnify REIT for any claims, losses, costs, fees, liabilities, damages, or injuries suffered by REIT arising out of CONSULTANT\\\\'s breach of this section. 9.6 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

However, should the Maintenance Fee not be increased by   the full extent of the CPI for any one year then, future increases to the   Maintenance Fee shall not exceed the difference between the actual   increases to the maintenance fee and the cumulative effect of the annual   increases in the CPI, for the immediately preceding thirty six consecutive   months period.   9. 7    The Maintenance Services may be terminated by TELKOM in writing at   any time upon 3 (three) months prior written notice. Subject to any   accrued rights and obligations, SAP AFRICA shall be entitled to   terminate the provision of Maintenance Services in respect of the   SOFTWARE or any modules thereof in the event of:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- 26 -                                             TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   9. 7. 1           an unremedied material breach of this AGREEMENT by TELKOM;   and/or   9. 7. 2             should SAP AFRICA, SAP AG or their respective licensors, cease, for   whatever reason, providing such Maintenance Services,   provided that in the latter case, SAP AFRICA and /or SAP AG shall procure   that COMMERCE ONE INC.. Inc. shall provide the Maintenance Service   and any related obligations of SAP Africa when providing Maintenance   Service in terms of this AGREEMENT including, its\\\\' obligations arising out   of annexure 3 Any Maintenance Fees paid in advance will be refunded to   TELKOM.   9. 8    Wherever in terms of this AGREEMENT, TELKOM is obliged or required   to provide remote access for whatever reason to SAP AFRICA, then   SAP AFRICA and its representatives, shall comply strictly with   TELKOM\\\"S internal policies, arrangements and procedures with regard   thereto.   9. 9    SAP AFRICA shall use its best endeavours to meet and comply with the   projected resolution times set out in annexure 2 hereto.   10.

The Maintenance Fee shall be calculated at 17% of the License fee stipulated in          annexure 1 for the license of the SOFTWARE.   2.     MAINTENANCE SERVICES   SAP Africa (\\\"SAP\\\") endeavours to provide the highest quality support and to ensure system stability throughout the life cycle of the Software solution. TELKOM will benefit through a lower total cost of ownership and will, in the future, experience an optimal usage of system resources and protection of existing investments.            7 x 24h Support Worldwide   SAP Customer Support delivers help for software problems in a fast and competent manner. SAP provides a 7 x 24h Support availability for messages with \\\\'very high\\\\' priority using the \\\\'Follow-the-Sun\\\\' model. At any given time of day an expert will be at hand to provide advice.   All Support centres are linked through a unique Support infrastructure, ensuring that all information provided to SAP is on hand regardless where or when.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- 58 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   Software Maintenance   Software Maintenance includes the further improvement of the software, as well as the continuous adaptation of the software to new database and operating system versions.  Each new release contains solutions to all known software errors.   Delivery of Functional Enhancements and Updates to the R/3 Software   SAP and its Licensors continuously enhance and improve the Software to ensure that Licensees customers always have the latest technology and business functions (e. g. functionality supporting the introduction of the Euro). SAP ensures that customers always receive the latest release of the R/3 software as soon as it becomes available.    Integrated Support for SAP and Partner Products   SAP maintains Collaborative Support Agreements with SAP Partners who have provided Licensees with hardware, operating system and database platforms to ensure seamless support. Should a Licensee request SAP require the involvement of the respective partner, SAP has established interfaces and procedures to do so.    Access to \\\\'SAP\\\\'s Frontend (formerly: OSS)   SAP\\\\'sFrontend is a quick and user-friendly interface for communication between customers and SAP. Features include:   - Access to the Software Support Package repository for downloads   - Database access to individual problem solutions for downloads   - Knowledge Database access to a wealth of information on the use of the Software   - Electronic notification about important information (HotNews)   - Access to SAP\\\\'s request handling process.   Support Services   The requirement for deriving the full benefit from SAP\\\\'s Global Support Network is a remote connection from the customer\\\\'s Software System to SAP\\\\'s Frontend. This enables the efficient usage of SAP\\\\'s portfolio of Remote Services and will enable customers to work with the SAP Support experts whenever required and in particular, at the start of their\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- 59 -     TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01   implementation. Also, a remote connection is a prerequisite for 7 x 24h support for priority 1 messages.   Under the TeamSAP Support maintenance agreement, SAP Support deals with problem messages pertaining to:   - An error in the software   - An error in the software causes subsequent errors   - There are problems when implementing corrections   - There is no training or documentation available   - The functions are not logical   - The software ergonomics has flaws   Messages of this nature are responded to in writing via SAP\\\\'s Frontend.   Any other messages are termed consulting issues and may be processed by either SAP\\\\'s Remote Consulting department, the customer\\\\'s implementation consultants or SAP consultants. This service is, however, priced separately and is not within scope of the maintenance agreement. Messages of this nature usually concern:   -  Processing logic of the software, the business processes and customising (questions  regarding working with transactions, programs and screens, the contents of screens  and  pr in touts ,   e tc .   )   - Administration or tuning of the SAP System, of the database or the operating system   - Errors caused by a modification of the system   - A solution is clear from the short text or from the help text of the system error   Maintenance Service Levels   Optimum support with fast reaction times is the cornerstone of SAP\\\\'s Support organisation. SAP\\\\'s Support process uses a three-tier Support structure:    Local Support (in 50 countries worldwide)   Local Support Centres at SAP subsidiaries are the local contact points for customers. During usual working hours, the Local Support Centres handle all inquiries relating to support in the language of the respective country and, if necessary, forward them to the\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-60-    TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01    appropriate local partner or the nearest Regional Support Centre. Most inquiries are entered via SAP \\\\'s Frontend which offers all the advantages of automatic dispatching.    Regional Support (more than 400 Support professionals in four Regional Support Centres)   Regional Support Centres are located in Walldorf, Germany (Europe/Africa), Philadelphia, USA (Americas), Singapore (Asia-Pacific) and Tokyo, Japan (North East Asia). These Centres are responsible for processing support inquiries and also form part of the 7 x 24h support network. According to the \\\\'FoIlow-the-Sun\\\\' principle, inquiries received outside normal working hours are automatically forwarded to the Regional Support Centre that is currently active. Another task is the co-ordination of regional partners in their co-operation with SAP customers.    Development Support (Europe, Americas, Asia)   SAP Africa\\\\'s Local Support Centre supports all SAP customers in the Southern Africa/Sub- Sahara region. In the event of SAP Africa being unable to respond timeously or effectively, the support query will be elevated to COMMERCE ONE INC.. Inc. consultants, in which event, SAP Africa shall use its best endeavours to respond timeously in accordance with the service levels stipulated in the table below.   The Quality Management processes implemented throughout the SAP Support organisation are certified globally according to the international standard ISO 9002.   The workflow between the support levels is defined in an internal Support Level Agreement (SLA) and SAP\\\\'s Support Process Monitoring team ensures that requests are forwarded smoothly between the support levels. SAP Africa, SAP AG and their respective licensors shall use their best endeavours and efforts to ensure that the below mentioned Initial Reaction Times and Projected Resolution Times (\\\"PRT\\\") are achieved in 80% of all cases;   Priority   Very High (1)   High (2)   Medium (3)   Low (4)   Initial Reaction Time   (IRT)   30 minutes   2 hours   4 hours   8 hours   Projected Resolution Time   (PRT)   1 day   3 days   7 days   1 4 days   Priority 1: d, h, min = days, hours, minutes in actual time Priority 2, 3, 4: d, h, min = days, hours, minutes during office hours\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- 61 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   The initial reaction time (IRT) is the time elapsed between message receipt at SAP (\\\"Send to SAP\\\" in SAP Service System) and initial contact with the customer or change of the message status.   The Projected Resolution Time (PRT) is the time elapsed between IRT and providing a solution.   Priorities of messages are defined as follows:    Very High or Priority 1   A message with priority \\\"Very high\\\" is justified when critical restrictions in day-to-day operations are encountered. Critical tasks, especially time-critical jobs, cannot be performed, due to a total system shutdown or a malfunction in a main function of the production SAP system.   This message requires immediate processing, as the malfunction can result in serious losses.    High or Priority 2   A message with priority \\\"High\\\" is justified when serious restrictions in day-to-day operations are encountered. Necessary tasks cannot be performed due to a malfunction or failed function in the Software that is urgently required in the current situation.   The message requires rapid processing, because the continuing malfunction could cause a serious interruption in the entire production system.    Medium or Priority 3   A message with priority \\\"Medium\\\" is justified when restrictions in day-to-day operations are encountered. This is caused by a malfunction or failed functionality in the system.    Low or Priority 4   A message with priority \\\"Low\\\" is justified when day-to-day operations are not affected or only affected in a minor fashion. This is caused by a malfunction or failed functionality in the system that is not used daily or is only used rarely.   (Problem situations in test systems will normally result in a priority that is one level lower than the identical problem in a production system).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- 62 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   On the anniversary of this AGREEMENT, the parties shall enter into discussions and   negotiations for the purposes of reviewing the aforestated maintenance service level terms,   more particularly, the related commercial terms thereof including, the maintenance fee and/or   percentages; the response, processing and resolution times; the penalties that may be   payable by SAP Africa and/or its licensors for failing to comply with such times and other   aspects of the maintenance services. The parties acknowledge that the market for the   SOFTWARE in South Africa is limited and that therefor it may be difficult to ascertain market   conditions for the purposes of reviewing such commercial and related terms. Accordingly,   the parties shall take cognisance of market conditions in other countries where the   SOFTWARE is being used. Should the parties be unable to agree upon any such   amendments within 30 days from the anniversary date, then such dispute shall be referred   for determination by the Arbitration Foundation of Southern Africa (\\\"AFSA\\\") in accordance   with the rules of AFSA and to an arbitrator appointed by the Chairperson of AFSA upon   application by either party. The arbitrator shall upon request of either party, appoint a   suitably qualified expert to assist him in determining the dispute. Except in the case of   manifest error, the arbitrators\\\\' ruling shall be final and binding upon the parties but shall be   without prejudice to a party\\\\'s other rights and obligations arising from the AGREEMENT.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- 6 3 -    TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01     Customer Message Support   The process of customer message support is the interface between development and service. The process steps that impact upon the SLA are customer message recording, preliminary checking, search for relevant error notes (known problem solution), and problem analysis.   Life Cycle of a Customer Message   Refer to accompanying PDF for diagram    Telkom customers can access the SAP\\\\'s Frontend or SAPNet-Web Frontend and create their own requests and messages. Customer requests and messages that are received in writing via fax (+27 11 2356004) are first processed by the support facility of the Local Support Centre and then recorded for further processing in SAP\\\\'s internal customer support system. A request or message is automatically assigned to an administrator in the SAP support organization (Local Support and Regional Support for the Software) based on the components assigned to it.   Performing preliminary checks, searching for troubleshooting information   The processor first checks whether the problem report is complete, and whether an entry has already been made in the system containing a solution to the reported problem. This search is conducted semi-automatically in SAP\\\\'s support system. If an entry is found containing a solution to the problem, then the person who had submitted the problem report is notified in writing via SAPNet and the problem is closed for SAP.   Problem Analysis   If, following preliminary analysis, the Local Support level decides that the problem must be handled by an expert in the respective component, the problem is passed on to the Regional\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- 64 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   Support level. If the problem involves a program error or if the processor cannot find a solution despite intensive analysis, he or she transfers it to the Development Support level. The responsibility for Development Support lies with the user departments of the development areas.   If no relevant error note (known solution) exists, the customer shall provide SAP with sufficient test time and support, as an attempt is made to reproduce the reported problem and to determine whether it is a problem with the software (at SAP or in the customer\\\\'s system, provided that the latter does not negatively affect the customer\\\\'s operations). If this reproduction of the problem is not possible, the next time the problem occurs, additional analyses are performed to narrow down the source of the problem. In the meantime, the problem receives the status of \\\"customer action\\\" in the support system. If special handling by an expert is required, then it is relayed to Development Support.   Escalation Management   In the event of SAP\\\\'s Support Management deciding that the standard support processes are insufficient to solve a critical customer situation (problems as described in point 2 above) a formal escalation process is invoked.   During this process, SAP will assign the required SAP personnel to the customer remotely (via a remote connection) and/or on site, as appropriate. These resources will be under the direct supervision of SAP\\\\'s management and the customer will not incur any costs.   A formal de-escalation process, involving an assigned Customer Services Manager, will take place once the critical issue has been resolved.   During the implementation phase prior to the SOFTWARE being installed, SAP AFRICA and TELKOM will negotiate with each other to discuss and agree upon an appropriate detailed escalation process for the Maintenance Services that SAP AFRICA and its licensors will provide and that will apply during the said implementation phase and the \\\"go-live\\\" stage. The parties shall also determine an escalation process that is appropriate for TELKOM\\\\'S needs and business requirements when USING the SOFTWARE.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-65-    TELKOM CONTRACTN0. 076C/01   THUS DONE AND SIGNED at  WOODMEAD  by SYSTEMS APPLICATIONS PRODUCTS   (AFRICA) (PROPRIETARY) LIMITED    on this 31st day of  March 2001    /S/                  /S/                                                   (who warrants his authority to so sign)   For:  TELKOM  SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED             (who warrants his authority to so sign)   /s/                                                                THUS DONE AND SIGNED at  Pretoria by the TELKOM SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED    on this 31st day of  March 2001 in the presence of the undersigned witnesses       AS WITNESSES     Signature         /S/        Signature         /S/\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- 66 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   ANNEXURE 3   to   AGREEMENT   between   SYSTEMS APPLICATION PRODUCTS (AFRICA) (PTY) LTD   with   TELKOM SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED   1.

Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. No assignment permitted by this Section 8.01 shall release the assigning Party from liability for the full performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the licenses retained by a Divested Entity extend to products, product lines, services, apparatus, devices, systems, components, hardware, software, processes, solutions, any combination of the foregoing, or other offerings of a third party acquirer existing on or before the date of the divestment, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such divestment.\\\\n\\\\nARTICLE IX TERMINATION\\\\n\\\\nSection 9.01.

(\\\"REIT\\\" or the \\\"Company\\\"), a Maryland corporation, collectively the \\\"Parties.\\\" NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and other good and valuable consideration, the Parties hereby agree as follows: 1. Consulting Services. REIT hereby retains CONSULTANT and CONSULTANT hereby accepts appointment to serve as an independent contractor to the Company. During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall consult with REIT and provide the services outlined in the attached Statement of Work in a timely and professional manner in accordance with industry standards. CONSULTANT further agrees that it will not assign the responsibilities set forth in the attached Statement of Work to any other CONSULTANT, subcontactor or other individual without the express written agreement of the Company\\\\'s Chief Executive Officer. 2. No Control by the Company. The Parties agree that CONSULTANT shall use its own judgment as to the time, place, details, and means by which CONSULTANT will accomplish the results of CONSULTANT\\\\'s services under this Agreement, that CONSULTANT is not required to work set hours of the day or week established by the Company or perform specific services in a sequence determined by the Company, and that nothing contained herein shall be construed to create the relationship of employer and employee between the Company or CONSULTANT; provided, however, that CONSULTANT is expected to provide the services contemplated by this Agreement in a timely and competent manner in order to meet the needs and expectations of the Company. 3. Independent Contractor. The Parties expressly intend and agree that CONSULTANT is acting as an independent contractor and not as an employee of REIT. Under no circumstances shall CONSULTANT look to REIT as its employer, or as a partner, agent, or principal. CONSULTANT has no right or authority to act as an agent of REIT or for or on behalf of the Company in any capacity whatsoever or to assume or create any obligation of any kind - express or implied - on behalf of REIT. 4. Compensation and Reimbursement. CONSALTANT agrees to be reimbursed for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its services, including but not limited to travel, lodging, meals, transportation, supplies, equipment, travel expenses, office space, telephone, internet, computer, software, printing, photocopying, mailing, postage, insurance, taxes, legal, accounting, auditing, consulting, design, marketing, promotion, advertising, public relations, publicity, training, etc., as well as any and all other reasonable and necessary expenses and out-of-pocket costs incurred by it during the course of performing its duties. In the event that any such costs or expenses are not reimbursable under any applicable law or regulation, then the amount of such reimbursement shall not be less than the maximum amount permitted by such applicable laws or regulations. Any such expenses shall also be paid in cash or by wire transfer of funds to a bank account designated in writing by either party. All such payments and reimbursements shall become due and payable upon the occurrence of an event of default, as defined in Section 9.01 of Exhibit A hereto, which shall have occurred and be in full force and effect on the date hereof or such other date as may be mutually agreed upon by both parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment or reimbursement is made by a party hereunder, such party shall promptly notify the other party thereof and shall pay the same within five (5) business days after receipt of notice thereof. If any party fails to pay any amount due to another party as provided herein, it shall bear the default interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum, compounded daily, from and after such failure until the payment is fully made, unless the failure is caused by force majeure or an act or omission of a third party which is beyond the reasonable control of one or both of them. For the avoidance of doubt, no such interest shall accrue or be payable on any amounts paid to or owed by one party in respect of services rendered by that party, whether or not those amounts are due or owing to such person. To the extent that the parties have agreed to indemnify each other for any breach of their respective covenants and agreements, they shall each be responsible for the full payment of all such indemnification obligations, without regard to whether the breach is a material breach or a non-material breach. Each party hereby agrees not to assert any claim or cause of action, except for claims arising out of or relating to its breach by reason of gross negligence or willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation or misstatement of material fact. This indemnity agreement shall survive the termination or dissolution of either the Agreement or any contract or agreement to which it relates, but shall terminate immediately upon a breach thereof or upon dissolution or liquidation thereof, whichever occurs first. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this agreement, neither party will have any liability or obligation to make any payments or reimburse any expenses or costs, direct or indirect, arising from the acts, omissions, negligence, misconduct, misrepresentations or statements of fact or representations made or omitted to have been made in good faith by any person or entity acting within the scope of his or her employment, business or professional capacity, nor shall any act, omission, statement or representation be deemed to constitute a waiver or release of that person from liability for damages or obligations arising therefrom or from any prior or subsequent acts or ommissions. Neither party has any duty to disclose any confidential or proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how, ideas, plans, methods, techniques, procedures, data, records, documents, drawings, inventions, designs, patents, trademarks, copyrights, licenses, franchises, intellectual property rights or trade names, any of which are the property of another or are subject to proprietary rights of third parties, other than as required by law to protect the rights and interests of itself, its employees, agents, officers, directors, shareholders, partners, members, employees and agents of other parties or others. It is understood and agreed that all information disclosed by each party pursuant to this paragraph shall remain confidential and will be treated as such confidential information in its entirety, regardless of whether such information is disclosed to others or whether it is publicly available or otherwise made available to other persons or entities. Nothing herein contained shall limit the right to inspect, copy or duplicate any documents or information that is or may become the subject of disclosure under applicable federal, state or local laws, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, judgments, injunctions, subpoenas, requests for production, court orders or similar legal process, provided that such inspection, copying or duplication shall only be permitted in compliance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations and the terms and conditions of each such law, rule, order, decree, judgment or injunction, subpoena or court order or process. Upon request, each Party shall provide such documents and information as it deems necessary or appropriate to enable it to comply with its obligations under its respective agreements and to carry out its responsibilities and duties under these terms. Consistent with such obligations and responsibilities, a Party may, at any time and from time to time at its sole discretion and expense, use the information and documents provided to it by another Party for such purposes as are reasonably necessary to perform the obligations or duties of said Party under such agreement.

The parties wish to produce a series of recorded compilations and companion song books featuring praise and worship repertoires, which will be co-branded and co-marketed throughout the world. Now, therefore, the parties agree as follows:\\\\n\\\\n1.       Product Concept and Creation.\\\\n\\\\n      a.       Product description. The product to be created under the                   series trade name \\\"Songs 4 Worship\\\" will be a praise and                   worship continuity series, with each volume in the series                   containing approximately 22 songs. Each volume will be                   manufactured in Double CD, Double Cassette, and song book                   formats, with standard double jewel boxes, inlays, booklets                   and j-cards (the \\\"Product\\\"). TL and Integrity will jointly                   develop the repertoire, and all repertoire selections are                   subject to master, mechanical and technical approval. All                   songs selected for the Product will have been previously                   recorded by Integrity and will not be new compositions.                   All songs in this series are intended for use in worship                   services, as well as for personal use by worship leaders,                   pastors and other worship professionals. This series is                   not intended to compete with any other product or                   service, nor is it intended as a substitute for other                   products or services. In addition, this product is not                   intended or authorized for resale or distribution to any                   other person or entity, except as expressly permitted by                   this Agreement. No part of this agreement may be modified                   or amended without the prior written consent of the other party                   (except as set forth in Section 6). All rights, title and                 interest in and to this Product are hereby transferred to                   Integrity, its successors and assigns (collectively referred                   to herein as the \\\"Licensee\\\"), and the Licensee hereby agrees                   that it shall have the exclusive right to use, reproduce,                 publish, distribute, display, perform, modify, translate,               adapt, create derivative works from, or otherwise use this                   Product for any purpose whatsoever, including but not          limited to, any commercial or non-commercial purpose, without                   payment of any royalties or other compensation to Integrity or                    TL, but only in accordance with the terms and conditions of                   the Agreement and in compliance with all applicable                   laws and regulations. Nothing herein shall be construed as                   authorizing or obligating TL or any of its affiliates to                 provide any services to the public other than those                   provided by TL. TL shall not have any right or authority                   under any federal, state or local law or regulation to                  provide or permit the sale, rental, lease, lending,                  transfer, distribution, reproduction, publication,                    display or performance of a copy of or a portion of                    this material, whether in whole or in part, unless                    expressly authorized in writing by the Copyright                    Office. Any unauthorized use or reproduction by any                    third party shall constitute a violation of all                    applicable laws, regulations and intellectual property                   rights of Integrity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, TL                   may, at its sole discretion and expense, use the                    Product in connection with its own promotional                   activities, such as sponsorships, events, conferences and                    other similar activities. However, no such use shall                   constitute an offer to sell, rent or lease the                  Product to third parties or be considered as an                    offer or solicitation to buy or sell any such                  products, services or goods.     b.      Product Development. Integrity shall develop this                  series in collaboration with TL in order to create a                   product that will meet the needs of both parties.                  The Product shall consist of two volumes, each of which                   shall contain a total of approximately twenty-two songs                   in a variety of genres and styles. These songs will                   be selected from a pool of songs that have already                   been recorded for this purpose. Songs selected will                  be chosen by a committee of representatives from both                   Integreity and TL to ensure that the songs chosen                   are of high quality and that they are representative                   of current trends and popular music. As a matter of                  course, these songs may not necessarily be the most                   popular or best-selling songs at the time of their                   selection. Therefore, it is the intention that these                  songs be used in conjunction with other products                   developed by Integra and/or TL that are available                   on the Internet or through other channels. It is also                  the intent that all songs included in these volumes                   will comply with current copyright laws.    c.   Product Production. Integrate will produce the               Product using the best available recording technology                   for each song. Production will begin as soon as possible                  and be completed within 90 days from the date of                 the first song selected. During the course of production,          the song will undergo the following steps: (1) the              song shall undergo a master recording, (2) a mechanical                   recording will take place (3) an audio engineer will          record the master and mechanical recordings will                    be combined into a single master (4) audio engineers will           combine the mechanical recording and master recordings                   into the final product (5) all of these recordings                    will then be sent to TL for review and approval (6)           the product will go through a technical review by an                   engineer at TL (7) TL will review the technical                   reviews and make any necessary changes (8) final                   approval will come from TL's technical staff (9)                  final approval from Integrity's production staff will                 be received and approved by integrity's executive                   committee. Once approved, production will commence.          Production shall begin on a weekly basis and shall                    continue until the volume is complete and ready for                   shipment. If production is delayed due to unforeseeable                   circumstances, then the delay shall count as one week.         d. Product Packaging and Labeling. At the end of each                   week, all finished products will receive a label                   indicating the number of weeks since the previous week                   was completed. A label will also be attached to all                   final products which have not yet been shipped.           e.  Product Shipping and Delivery. Shipping of finished                    products shall commence immediately upon receipt of                the label. Products shipped shall arrive within five                   business days of receipt by certified mail, return                   receipt requested, postage prepaid and insured.            f. Rights and Licenses. Except as otherwise provided                   herein, neither party has any rights or licenses                   granted to it under copyright, trademark, patent, trade                   secret, confidentiality, non-disclosure or similar                    rights. Neither party is obligated to disclose any                  confidential information or proprietary information                   which it has learned or becomes aware of during                   production of products. To the extent that any product                   is sold or licensed to another party, either party                  shall retain all rights and licenses to such product                  in its possession and control. g. Confidentiality. Both                   parties shall keep confidential all information                  relating to products and services which is                  disclosed to or used by one or both of them in                   connection therewith. h. Termination. Either party may                   terminate the agreement at any time upon written                   notice. Such termination shall take effect immediately                   upon such written notice being given. i. Governing Law and                  Jurisdiction. Entire Agreement: This agreement is                    the sole and exclusive agreement between the                     parties and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous                   agreements, understandings, representations and                     warranties, oral or written, made or given by either                   party or by its officers, directors, employees,                     consultants, agents, attorneys, partners, shareholders,           and affiliates. j.

Severability. Should any provision or            clause hereof be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable                  under applicable law, that invalidity, illegality or              non-enforceability shall in no way affect the remaining                  validity, legality or enforceability of such provision                  or clause or the validity or legality of other                  provisions, clauses or provisions which are not                  affected by such provisions or clauses. m.

Force Majeure. Upon the occurrence of an                  event or condition beyond the reasonable control of            each party which results in an inability to perform                  its obligations hereunder, if such inability continues                  beyond a reasonable period of time (i.e., more than                  six months), then such party's obligations under                  this section shall survive the expiration of that                  period. o. Waiver of Jury Trial.

However, it's important to note that this is based on the findings from a single study and more research is needed to confirm this association.\\n\\nAdditionally, other studies have shown that HAdV-7 infection can cause a more severe disease compared to HAdV-3, and HAdV-7-positive inpatients had lower white blood cell counts, including T-cells, on admission.
